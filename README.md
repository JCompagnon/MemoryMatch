# MemoryMatch
*This project and readme are "works" in progress*

## What even is this...
This is a basic game about realizing how terrible my memory is. The player is given a set of face-down cards, and must pair up matching cards to gain points. 
This is just a silly side project to learn about making NodeJS apps. As a terrifying "might as well...", I figured I'd try one of those shiny client-side JS libraries as well (went with VueJS).

## Why though?
I've been learning and loving .NET web development, but feel my JS skills could use some improvement. This is the first iteration of "**Hey maybe try to address that then**".

## How did I end up here?
If you didn't get an invitation, then I have no idea. If you did, then welcome! - And I still have no idea
