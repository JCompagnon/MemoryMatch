# MemoryMatch
*This project and readme are works in progress*

## What is this?
This is a basic game about realizing how terrible my memory is. The player is given a set of face-down cards, and must pair up matching cards to gain points. 
This is just a silly side project to learn about making NodeJS apps, while getting some exposure to VueJS

## Why though?
I've been learning and loving .NET web development, but am interested in learning more JS, both client- and server-side.
